# Flappy-Bird-Windows-Form

# Made entirely in .NET Windows Form

# Some bug fixes to be addressed:
* Image transparency issues
* Flappy birds death at top of screen (looks off...)

# Game improvements
* Cleanliness of score text (add borders and such)
* Background to be added (parallax scrolling)
* High-score implementations/game over screens
* Possible animations for death/movement
